        You can specify a special spliterator with a regex. This spliterator will then be used to split the job name
        and each part of the split name then can be used in the filed below (Comparator tool arguments) as a special
        macro and make the definition of custom arguments easier. These macros are described in the help of
        <i>Comparator tool arguments</i> field.
    </p>
    <p>
        An example of this spliterator can for example be "<code>[.-]</code>", which will split the name by either a
        dot or a hyphen character.
