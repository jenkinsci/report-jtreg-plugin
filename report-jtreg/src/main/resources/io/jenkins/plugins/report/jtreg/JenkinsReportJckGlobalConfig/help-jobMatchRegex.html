        This field is used for writing a regular expression that will match against the jobs' names.
        If the job name matches this regex, the set of links below will be shown on the report page.
    </p>
    <p>
        This partition into groups is done, so you can specify different comparator arguments on different types of
        jobs. But if you want to have the same links everywhere, you can always set the regex to "<code>.*</code>".
