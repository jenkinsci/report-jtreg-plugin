<div>
    Packages blacklisted (java regex, space separated) are shown in results (to allow filtering of individual job IDs) show only specific brach or similarly. For example:<br/>
    <span style="font-family: monospace">.*2\.6\.6\.0.*</span><br/>
    BlackList has always priority over WhiteList
</div>
